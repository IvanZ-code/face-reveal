An app for finding people and their gender in a photo.
The .data folder contains the neural networks that I used to determine face and gender.
The .test folder contains some test images.
If you need to create such an application with your own domain, you need to copy all the files from this repository to your own and then run it through streamlit service.
You can see the result of the application's work at the link:
